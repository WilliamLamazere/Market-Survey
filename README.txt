Project : Conduct a market survey, with the data coming from the FAO http://www.fao.org/faostat/fr. This is a project of Openclassrooms' Data Analytics track.

This included various steps:
- data preprocessing
- unsupervised techniques to distinguish groups of countries having similar aspects (hierarichal classification with WARD's algorithm / Kmeans )
- metrics to assess optimal clustering (silhouette metric, elbow technique with variance maximisation)
- Dimension reduction (PCA) to extract meaningful information for visualisation
- once clusters selected, pick of best countries within
- statistical tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Bartlett, Kolmogorov-Smirnov) to validate our hypothesis
